Psychopy Spatial Working Memory Test
=========================================

This is a `Psychopy <https://psychopy.org/>`_ project consisting of a spatial working memory task. 

In each trial of the experiment, the participant is shown a sequence of squares lighting up. The participant is then to click the squares in the same sequence that they lit up. The sequences increases in length from 2 to 9 squares, with 3 trials for each difficulty level. If the participant fails all trials of a difficulty level, the experiment ends straight away in order to prevent participant frustration.

Placement of target numbers is randomly generated in a way that prevents overlapping targets. 

Most experiment specifications, e. g. number of trials/difficulty level, min/max difficulty level, square size et c, are done in a code snippet linked to the first routine (in the PsychoPy Builder interface). All instruction messages (currently in Swedish) are also defined in this code snippet, to simplify translation.
