To use a translation, open up the experiment's .psyexp file with PsychoPy Builder. Go to the first routine, 'instructions_part1' and open up the 'code_constants' code component. In the 'Before Experiment' tab, scroll down to the section '## EXPERIMENT MESSAGES ##' (around line 140-150). Replace all the code in this section (down to '## END EXPERIMENT MESSAGES ##') with the code from the translation you chose.

If you want to create your own translation, simply copy one of the already existing translation files and insert your own texts, following the format of the prior translation. Make sure to use newline '\n' and whitespace ' ' characters to separate your texts properly, again like in the prior translation's formatting.

The translation files include lines like `INSTRUCTIONS_CONTINUE_TXT_PLACEMENT = (0, -6)` which only have to do with the placement of instructions, not the instructions themselves. You usually don't need to change these, but they serve as a reminder that you should always check to see if the instructions are placed/sized correctly and have enough space. If your translation requires more space/different placements, then do change these configurations as well.
